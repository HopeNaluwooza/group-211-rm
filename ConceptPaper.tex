\section{Introduction.}

The “Product-Mix Auction” is a single-round auction that can be used whenever an auctioneer wants to sell or buy multiple differentiated goods. It allows all participants to express their preferences between varieties, as well as for alternative quantities of specific varieties.
The relevance of this research is to help organizations to acquire products they might need or to sell those they might deem disposable. The findings of this research might will enable these organizations to price various products appropriately depending on the reigning market conditions. The target market for this reserach is organizations that at some point in time might need to dispose off company property through product-mix auction.

\section{Background.}
The Product-Mix Auction was devised by Klemperer in 2008 for the purpose of providing liquidity to commercial banks during the financial crisis; it was used for a number of years by the Bank of England.
It uses bids that represent the amounts a buyer is willing to pay for certain bundles of goods, and the "correct" prices (causing the available supply of goods to be released to the buyers) can be found by solving a linear program. The project investigates an extension to the original auction that allows buyers more flexibility to express their requirements. This extension, allowing "negative bids" to be made, allows a buyer to express any "strong substitutes" demand function. In this extension, the search for prices has the form of a convex optimisation problem, and the project envisages implementing the Ellipsoid Method to find the prices, along with local search heuristics. The Ellipsoid Method runs in polynomial time but is slow in practice; at present we have no guarantee for the performance of the local-search approach, but it's of interest to see how it performs in practice, on simulated data.
